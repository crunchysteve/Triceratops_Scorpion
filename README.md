# Triceratops_Scorpion
A refinement on Triceratops 2pointOMG

This is the beginning and outlining of refinements to the Triceratops lean-steering trike project. These atre the preliminary OpenSCAD sketches that outline the concept. The drawings currently have no rear triangle, no lean-steer brackets, nor any tierods as I'm still working on thos parts.

Triceratops Two Point OMG is still under construction. (eg, parts in a box, no welding yet due to months of shitty weather.) This is a refinement of the design for use in construction of an e-assist version, with a 900mm wheelbase and the "scorpion claws" crossmember which reduces the wheel encroachment that I suspect might be a small problem with the 2.OMG design.

Files will be uploaded in the next few hours. Meds to take and a cat to feed. The life of an oldie, oh fun :D
